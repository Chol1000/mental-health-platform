    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Mental health Platform, a platform designed to support
      mental well-being by providing personalized self-care tools,
      emotional tracking, and valuable mental health resources. We understand
      that mental health is just as important as physical health, and our mission
      is to make mental wellness accessible to everyone, no matter where they are
      or what challenges they face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people struggle with stress, anxiety, and emotional ups and downs but
      may not have access to professional help due to cost, stigma, or lack of
      resources. That’s where we come in—we offer a safe, non-judgmental space
      where users can take control of their mental well-being at their own pace.
    </p>
